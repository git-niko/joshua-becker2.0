[![Joshua Becker written in white script on a black geometric background.](https://github.com/git-niko/joshua-becker2.0/blob/e7d020e0678aebaa1cadc507a09565e5c26e2676/git-promo.png)](https://git-niko.github.io/joshua-becker2.0/)

## Overview

Becomingminimalist.com is a platform featuring author, writer, and philanthropist Joshua Becker, sharing his insights on minimalism through his blog. In addition to the blog, the website also showcases his books, magazines, speaking events and book tours, courses, and mobile app dedicated to minimalism. 

The website is text-heavy with several pages, making it difficult to navigate and locate information. Using the brand's existing content and copy, I redesigned the interface with a new color scheme, prioritizing accessibility, usability, and user satisfaction. Integration of third-party features provided dynamic and engaging content. The outcome was a more visually appealing, streamlined website that provided a better user experience.
